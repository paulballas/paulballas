            p.type-secondary.small I have worked on a variety of web and mobile applications in my 8 years of experienceâ€”everything from an iOS and Android app for the state of Texas to an internal web app for travel agents. Every project has challenged me and taught me something new. Below is a sample of a just a few of the many projects I was a part of.
